## Coding Standards

### PHP Style

We follow PSR-12 coding standards. Key points:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Namespace declarations must be on their own line
- Opening braces for classes and methods go on the next line
- Control structure opening braces go on the same line

### Commit Messages

We use conventional commits for clear history:

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(commands): add cache:cascade:warm command
fix(trait): handle soft deletes in cascade invalidation
docs(readme): add Laravel 11 compatibility note
test(fake): add assertions for visitor isolation
```

### Testing

- Write tests for any new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example:
```php
public function test_cache_invalidation_clears_all_layers()
{
    // Arrange
    CacheCascade::set('key', 'value');
    
    // Act
    CacheCascade::invalidate('key');
    
    // Assert
    $this->assertNull(CacheCascade::get('key'));
}
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes

- Include code examples in documentation
- Keep language clear and concise
